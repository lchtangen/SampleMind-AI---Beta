DEBUG=false
SECRET_KEY=<64-char-random-string>
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
REDIS_URL=redis://...
CORS_ORIGINS=https://samplemind.ai
SENTRY_DSN=https://...
```

- First input delay: <100ms

## Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Detected

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Stop new deployments
   - Assess impact severity
   - Notify team

2. **Rollback Decision**
   - Critical: Rollback immediately
   - High: Fix forward or rollback
   - Medium: Fix forward
   - Low: Schedule fix

3. **Rollback Steps**
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous version
   git revert HEAD
   
   # Or rollback to specific commit
   git checkout <previous-stable-commit>
   
   # Deploy
   ./deploy.sh production
   
   # Verify
   ./health-check.sh
   ```

4. **Post-Rollback**
   - Communicate to users
   - Document incident
   - Root cause analysis
   - Prevention measures
