# Summary of European Lenders for Norwegian Residents

This document summarizes the findings of our research into European lenders and their suitability for a Norwegian resident seeking a personal loan.

## Key Findings

Our research has shown that most traditional and fintech lenders in Europe are not viable options due to their focus on domestic markets and strict credit check requirements. Microfinance institutions, while promising, also proved to be focused on their local markets.

The most promising options are the neobanks that operate across Europe and have more flexible application processes.

## Lender Analysis

Here is a breakdown of the institutions we have investigated:

| Lender | Viable Option? | Key Information |
|---|---|---|
| **Ferratum** | **Yes** | Operates in Norway and accepts Norwegian residents. A strong candidate, especially now that the Intrum claim is settled. |
| **Revolut** | **Potentially** | Offers personal loans in several European countries, but availability in Norway is unconfirmed. **Action required: Check the Revolut app.** |
| **Monese** | **Potentially** | Offers a "Credit Builder" product and does not perform credit checks. Availability in Norway is unconfirmed. **Action required: Check the Monese app.** |
| **N26** | **No** | Does not offer personal loans in Norway. |
| **Bunq** | **No** | Does not offer personal loans. |
| **P2P Platforms (Mintos, Afranga, Lendermarket)** | **No** | These are investment platforms, not direct lenders. |
| **Microfinance Institutions (Fondi BESA, microStart, FAER, etc.)** | **No** | These institutions are focused on their domestic markets and do not offer cross-border loans. |

## Recommendations

Based on our research, the easiest and most promising path to obtaining credit is as follows:

1.  **Confirm Revolut and Monese:** The first and most critical step is to check your Revolut and Monese apps to see if personal loans or the Credit Builder product are available to you in Norway. This will determine our next steps.

2.  **Prioritize Monese:** If the Monese Credit Builder product is available, this is likely your best option. It is specifically designed to help individuals build a credit history and does not require a credit check.

3.  **Consider Revolut:** If Revolut offers personal loans in Norway, this is also a strong option, as you are already a customer.

4.  **Revisit Ferratum:** If neither Revolut nor Monese are viable options, our original plan of applying to Ferratum is the next logical step. With the Intrum claim settled, your application will be much stronger.

A Swiss bank account is not likely to provide any significant advantage in this process. The key is to find a lender that operates in Norway and has a flexible approach to credit assessment.
