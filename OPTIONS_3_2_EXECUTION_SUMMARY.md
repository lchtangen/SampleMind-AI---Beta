## 📋 EXECUTION ORDER

### Phase 1: Database Initialization (15 min)
**Guide:** DATABASE_INIT_GUIDE.md

**Quick Commands:**
```bash
# 1. Start PostgreSQL (if not running)
docker-compose up -d postgres
# OR
brew services start postgresql@15

# 2. Navigate to backend
cd backend

# 3. Install dependencies (if needed)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with database credentials

# 5. Initialize database
python scripts/init_db.py

# 6. Apply migrations
alembic upgrade head

# 7. Verify
psql postgresql://samplemind:samplemind123@localhost:5432/samplemind -c "\dt"
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Database created
- ✅ Tables initialized (users, audio_files, audio_analysis)
- ✅ Test user created (test@samplemind.ai / test123456)
- ✅ Connection verified

---

### Phase 2: Full Stack Testing (20 min)
**Guide:** FULL_STACK_TEST_GUIDE.md

**Quick Commands:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Backend
cd backend
python main.py
# Wait for: "Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000"

# Terminal 2: Start Frontend
cd apps/web
pnpm dev
# Wait for: "Ready in X.Xs"

# Browser: Test Complete Flow
1. Open http://localhost:3000/login
2. Register: test@samplemind.ai / test123456
3. Should redirect to /dashboard
4. Click "Upload"
5. Drag & drop audio file
6. Watch progress → Success notification
7. Return to dashboard → File appears
8. Click "Logout"
