**Probability:** Low  
**Mitigation:**
- Test with small traffic %
- Monitor cache hit rates
- Verify content delivery
- Gradual traffic migration

#### Risk 5: Spot Instance Interruptions
**Impact:** Medium  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Auto-failover to on-demand
- Stateless worker design
- Queue-based processing
- Monitor interruption rates

### Low-Risk Items

#### Risk 6: Storage Migration Delays
**Impact:** Low  
**Probability:** Low  
**Mitigation:**
- Background migration
- No user impact
- Verify before deletion

## 🎯 Conclusion

Phase 7 represents a strategic optimization phase that will:

1. **Reduce costs by 40%** ($24,000 annual savings)
2. **Improve performance by 3x** across all metrics
3. **Maintain quality** (99.9%+ uptime, < 1% accuracy loss)
4. **Enable better scalability** economics
5. **Provide complete visibility** into costs and performance

The optimizations in Phase 7 are designed to be:
- **Non-disruptive:** No downtime or user impact
- **Reversible:** Quick rollback if issues arise
- **Measurable:** Clear metrics and benchmarks
- **Sustainable:** Long-term cost and performance benefits

**Phase 7 is READY TO START upon Phase 6 validation! 🚀**
