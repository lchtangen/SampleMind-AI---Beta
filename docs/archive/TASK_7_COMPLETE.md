## Technical Implementation

### Route Structure
```
/dashboard  - User dashboard with stats
/upload     - File upload and processing
/library    - Audio file library
/settings   - Account settings
```

### Shared Features Across All Pages
- ✅ Authentication guard (redirects to /login if not authenticated)
- ✅ Loading states with Spinner component
- ✅ Navbar integration
- ✅ Toast notifications for success/error
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile→tablet→desktop)
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### State Management Patterns
1. **Local State**: useState for component-specific data
2. **Global State**: Zustand store for authentication
3. **API State**: Loading states for async operations
4. **Form State**: Controlled inputs with validation

### Navigation Flow
```
Landing (/) 
  → Login (/login) 
    → Dashboard (/dashboard)
      → Upload (/upload) → Processing → Library (/library)
      → Library (/library) → Details Modal → Analyze
      → Settings (/settings) → Password Modal
```

### Components Reused from Task 6
- Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent
- Button (all variants)
- Input (with validation)
- Badge (6 variants)
- ProgressBar
- Spinner
- Modal
- EmptyState
- FileDropzone
- Navbar

## API Endpoints Used
