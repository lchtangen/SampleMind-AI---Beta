## 🚀 How to Rename

### Option 1: Simple Rename (Recommended)
```bash
# Navigate to parent directory
cd /home/lchta/Projects

# Rename the folder
mv samplemind-ai-v6 samplemind-ai-beta

# Or use a different name:
# mv samplemind-ai-v6 samplemind-phoenix
# mv samplemind-ai-v6 samplemind
```

### Option 2: Git-Aware Rename
```bash
# If you have remote repository
cd /home/lchta/Projects/samplemind-ai-v6

# Update remote URL if needed
git remote -v
# git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/new-repo-name.git

# Then rename folder
cd /home/lchta/Projects
mv samplemind-ai-v6 samplemind-ai-beta
```

## 📝 Post-Rename Updates

After renaming, you may need to update:

### 1. Virtual Environment Path (if using venv)
The `.venv` folder will still work, but paths may be absolute. To be safe:

```bash
cd /home/lchta/Projects/[NEW_NAME]

# Recreate virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

### 2. IDE/Editor Settings
- VS Code: Reopen folder
- PyCharm: Update project path
- Other editors: Reopen project

### 3. Shell History/Aliases
Your shell might have the old path in history - just update as needed.

---

## ✅ Verification After Rename

```bash
# Navigate to new location
cd /home/lchta/Projects/[NEW_NAME]

# Verify git still works
git status

# Verify Python package
python -c "import samplemind; print(samplemind.__version__)"
# Should print: 0.6.0-beta

# Run a quick test
python -m pytest tests/unit/core/test_audio_engine.py -v
# Should see: 23 passed
```

## 🎯 Suggested New Names

### Professional Options
- `samplemind-ai` - Clean, professional
- `samplemind-phoenix` - References the Phoenix upgrade
- `samplemind-beta` - Clear beta status
- `samplemind-production` - Future-looking

### Version-Based Options
- `samplemind-0.6` - Version-specific
- `samplemind-v0.6-stable` - Emphasizes stability

### Descriptive Options
- `samplemind-ai-platform` - Platform emphasis
- `samplemind-music-ai` - Clear purpose

**Recommendation:** `samplemind-ai` (clean and professional)

---

## 🔧 What Won't Break

These will continue to work after rename:
- ✅ All Python imports (package name is `samplemind-ai`, not folder name)
- ✅ Virtual environment (`.venv`)
- ✅ Git history
- ✅ All scripts and tools
- ✅ Documentation references (relative paths)

---

## ⚠️ What Might Need Updating

These might reference the old folder name:
- Shell scripts with absolute paths (check `scripts/` folder)
- README examples with paths
- CI/CD configurations (if using absolute paths)
- Docker configurations (if using absolute paths)

**Most likely:** Nothing will break because we use relative paths!
