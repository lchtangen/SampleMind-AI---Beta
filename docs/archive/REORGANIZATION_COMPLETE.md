- ✅ `web-app/` → `web/`

### 3. Flattened Structures
- ✅ **docs/** - Removed subdirs (`developer_guide/`, `guides/`, `setup/`, `development/`, `reference/`, `api/`)
  - Created `docs/archive/` for historical documents
  - Created `docs/examples/` for code examples
  - All other docs at `docs/*.md`

- ✅ **scripts/** - Removed subdirs (`setup/`, `test/`, `performance/`)
  - All scripts now at `scripts/*.sh` or `scripts/*.py`

### 4. Documentation Consolidation (40+ files moved)
- ✅ Moved setup guides: `QUICK_START.md`, `REQUIREMENTS_GUIDE.md`, `ELECTRON_SETUP_GUIDE.md`, `DESKTOP_FIX_GUIDE.md` → `docs/`
- ✅ Moved user guides: `USER_GUIDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md` → `docs/`
- ✅ Archived status reports: `BETA_STATUS_FINAL.md`, `TEST_INFRASTRUCTURE_COMPLETE.md`, `FIXES_COMPLETE.md`, `WARP.md` → `docs/archive/`
- ✅ Archived phase docs: `PHASE_*.md`, `TASK_*.md`, `*STATUS*.md`, `*COMPLETE*.md`, `*UPGRADE*.md` → `docs/archive/`
- ✅ Moved planning docs: `PROJECT_ORGANIZATION_PLAN.md`, `MINIMAL_STRUCTURE_PLAN.md` → `docs/`

### 5. File Cleanup
- ✅ Removed `.env.backup*` files (security risk)
- ✅ Removed `coverage.json` (test artifact)
- ✅ Removed `gemini.py` (duplicate/unused)
- ✅ Archived old `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` → `docs/archive/PROJECT_STRUCTURE_OLD.md`

### 6. Path Reference Updates
- ✅ `.github/workflows/dependency-update.yml` - Updated `web-app` → `web`
- ✅ `README.md` - Updated frontend path
- ✅ `desktop/README.md` - Updated all paths (web-app → web, electron-app → desktop)
- ✅ Created new `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` with minimal structure documentation
