## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Health Monitoring

**Check system health:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health/detailed
```

**Key metrics to watch:**
- `cache.hit_rate` - Should be 60-80% after warmup
- `performance.cpu_percent` - Should be <50% under normal load
- `performance.memory_mb` - Monitor for leaks
- `components` status - All should be "healthy"

### Cache Management

**View cache stats:**
```python
from src.samplemind.ai import get_cache_stats
stats = await get_cache_stats()
print(f"Hit rate: {stats['hit_rate']:.2%}")
```

**Clear cache for a provider:**
```python
from src.samplemind.ai import clear_provider_cache
await clear_provider_cache("openai")
```

**Warm cache:**
```bash
python -m src.samplemind.ai.warm --providers ollama gemini
```

### Troubleshooting

**Redis connection issues:**
- Expected from host (Redis is in Docker network)
- Works fine from within containers

**MongoDB restarting:**
- Known intermittent issue
- Usually resolves automatically
- `docker compose restart mongodb` if needed

**Tests running slow:**
- Make sure to use mocks: `pytest -m "not integration" -n auto`
- Check parallel workers: should see 6-12 workers
