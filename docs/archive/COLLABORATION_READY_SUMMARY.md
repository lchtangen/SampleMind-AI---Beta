## 💡 Tips for Success

### As First-Time Team Lead

**DO:**
- Start small (2-3 contributors)
- Over-communicate
- Write everything down
- Be patient with yourself and others
- Celebrate small wins

**DON'T:**
- Try to scale too quickly
- Assume people know what you know
- Merge your own PRs
- Let issues sit without response
- Expect perfection immediately

### Managing Contributors

**Good Practices:**
- Respond to issues/PRs within 24-48 hours
- Provide clear, constructive feedback
- Thank people for contributions
- Close stale issues (after warning)
- Keep roadmap updated

**Red Flags to Watch:**
- Contributors disappearing after first PR
- Too many issues, no progress
- Conflicts between contributors
- Scope creep in features
- Declining code quality
