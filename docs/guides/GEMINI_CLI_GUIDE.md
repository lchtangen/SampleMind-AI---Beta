# Get detailed production coaching
python main.py analyze my_track.wav --provider anthropic --type production_coaching

# Output Example:
🤖 Claude AI Analysis (Production Coaching)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📚 Technical Analysis:
Your track demonstrates solid fundamentals, but there are specific
areas where targeted improvements can elevate the production:

1. **Frequency Balance**: The mid-range (500Hz-2kHz) is slightly
   crowded. Consider using surgical EQ cuts around 800Hz on your
   bass and 1.2kHz on your lead synth to create separation.

2. **Dynamic Control**: Your kick drum is peaking at -3dB, which
   limits headroom for mastering. Try parallel compression instead
   of heavy limiting on the master bus.

💡 Production Techniques:
- Use sidechain compression with a ghost kick (volume at 0) for
  more consistent pumping without affecting your actual kick
- Layer your snare with 3 samples: low (body), mid (snap), high (air)
- Add subtle distortion before your reverb send for character

🚀 Next Steps:
1. A/B reference against [similar commercial track]
2. Check mono compatibility using Utility plugin
3. Address the 800Hz buildup with dynamic EQ
4. Add automation to filter cutoffs for movement
5. Consider side-chain your pad to the vocal for clarity
