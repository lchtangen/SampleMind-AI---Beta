# Phase 4: Advanced Features & Sub-phases

## Status: 🟡 PARTIAL (60%)

Advanced feature implementation including smart caching, audio processing, visualizations, and strategic enhancements.

## Overview

Phase 4 implements advanced features building upon the solid foundation of Phases 1-3. This phase is organized as multiple concurrent sub-phases and strategic features that enhance the core product. Due to complexity and resource allocation, certain features are deferred while others are prioritized.

## Key Deliverables

- ✅ Smart Caching (4.1C) - COMPLETED
- ⏳ Advanced Audio Processing (4.2) - IN PROGRESS
- 📋 Neural Audio Processing (4.3) - DEFERRED
- 📋 3D Visualizations - STRATEGIC FEATURE
- 📋 Cyberpunk UI Design - STRATEGIC ENHANCEMENT

## Notes

Phase 4 is strategically designed with multiple parallel work streams. Smart caching (4.1C) has been completed successfully. Audio processing continues in parallel with optimization work. Deferred features are documented and can be reactivated based on priority and resource availability.

The concurrent sub-phase approach allows rapid feature delivery while managing complexity and resource constraints.
