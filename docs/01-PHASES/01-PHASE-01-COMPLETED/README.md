# Phase 1: Core Architecture & Foundation

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

Core architecture establishment, development environment setup, and foundational implementation.

## Overview

Phase 1 established the fundamental architecture and framework for the SampleMind-AI project. This phase focused on setting up the development infrastructure, integrating the Phoenix framework, and creating core data models for the bulk import system.

## Key Deliverables

- ✅ Foundational architecture design
- ✅ Phoenix framework integration
- ✅ Development environment configuration
- ✅ Core data models implementation
- ✅ Bulk importer functionality
