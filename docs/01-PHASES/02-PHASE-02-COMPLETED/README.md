# Phase 2: Feature Implementation & Validation

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

Core feature implementation, sample suggestion system, and comprehensive validation framework.

## Overview

Phase 2 focused on implementing the primary features of SampleMind-AI, establishing the sample suggestion system, and creating validation layers to ensure data quality and consistency. This phase built upon the Phase 1 foundation to deliver user-facing functionality.

## Key Deliverables

- ✅ Core features fully implemented
- ✅ Sample suggestion system operational
- ✅ Validation framework complete
- ✅ Beta readiness achieved
- ✅ Feature completeness verified
