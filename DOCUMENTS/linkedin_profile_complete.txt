================================================================================
SECTION 2: ABOUT / SUMMARY (2600 character limit)
================================================================================

I represent an emerging archetype in technology: the customer-obsessed problem solver who wields AI as a strategic tool, not just a technical capability.

My unconventional journey—from customer service to self-taught AI developer—has equipped me with a rare combination: deep empathy for user needs paired with the technical sophistication to build enterprise-grade solutions. While most developers learn to code first and discover user problems later, I've inverted that sequence. This customer-backward thinking creates solutions people actually adopt, not just technically impressive projects that gather dust.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CURRENT FOCUS: SampleMind AI
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

I'm currently building SampleMind AI (https://github.com/lchtangen/SampleMind-AI---Beta), an AI-powered audio intelligence platform addressing a critical workflow bottleneck in the $4.5B music production software market.

Professional producers spend 30-40% of creative time organizing sample libraries rather than making music. SampleMind AI solves this through intelligent automation combining:
• OpenAI GPT-4 API for contextual understanding
• Local TensorFlow models for real-time classification  
• Docker containerization for cross-platform deployment
• MongoDB for flexible metadata persistence

This project positions me at the intersection of three exponentially-growing sectors: Generative AI (40% YoY growth), Music Technology ($4.5B market), and Creative Tools Revolution (Figma $20B acquisition validates this space).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STRATEGIC TRAJECTORY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

2025-2027: Completing upper secondary qualification (studiekompetanse) while building production AI applications
2027-2030: Computer Science bachelor's at EPFL Lausanne or ETH Zurich  
2030+: Leadership roles in AI-powered creative technology (Spotify ML, Adobe Firefly, music-tech startups)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT DIFFERENTIATES ME
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

My service industry background (4 years security operations, retail experience) cultivated instinctive pattern recognition for user friction points—the scarcest skill in AI-augmented development. I ask "What does the user actually need?" before writing code, ensuring technical work delivers genuine value.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT I'M SEEKING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Part-time technical roles, trainee positions, or IT support opportunities (15-20 hrs/week) where I can:
✓ Contribute immediately through Python development, AI integration, or technical support
✓ Learn from experienced engineers while bringing fresh AI-driven perspectives  
✓ Balance work with ongoing studies (flexible scheduling appreciated)
✓ Gain exposure to production systems and professional workflows

Ideal environments: Music technology startups, AI-first companies, creative tools developers, forward-thinking consultancies that value self-taught developers with customer empathy.

Companies building the future of human-AI interaction particularly resonate with my capabilities and vision.
