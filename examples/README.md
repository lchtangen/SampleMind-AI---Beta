This is an experimental version created during the beta polish phase. The standard entry point remains `main.py` at the project root.

**Features:**
- Enhanced error handling with custom exceptions
- Production-ready error reporting
- Improved banner and UI feedback
- Better async handling

**Usage:**
```bash
python examples/main_enhanced.py
