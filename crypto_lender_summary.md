# Summary of Crypto-Backed Loan Platforms

This document summarizes the findings of our research into crypto-backed loan platforms and their suitability for a Norwegian resident.

## Key Findings

Crypto-backed loans offer a viable "hack" or "workaround" to traditional lending, as they often do not require credit checks. However, they come with their own set of requirements and risks, primarily the need for significant crypto collateral.

## Platform Analysis

Here is a breakdown of the platforms we have investigated:

| Platform | Viable Option? | Key Information |
|---|---|---|
| **Figure** | **Yes** | Offers crypto-backed loans and does not list Norway as a restricted country. This is a strong candidate. |
| **Nebeus** | **Potentially** | A European-based platform with a global focus. While we could not definitively confirm their availability in Norway, their "digital nomad" branding is a positive sign. |
| **Coinbase** | **No** | Currently only offers loans to institutional and US-based clients. |
| **Crypto.com** | **Unlikely** | Appears to be restricting its lending services in many jurisdictions. |

## Recommendations

Based on our research, the most promising crypto-backed loan platforms are:

1.  **Figure:** They are the most likely to be available in Norway and have a straightforward application process.
2.  **Nebeus:** Their European base and global focus make them a strong contender, but you will need to verify their availability in Norway by attempting to create an account.

**Before you proceed, you must consider the following:**

*   **Do you have sufficient crypto assets to use as collateral?** You will likely need to pledge at least twice the amount you wish to borrow.
*   **Are you comfortable with the risks of crypto volatility?** If the value of your collateral drops, you may be required to add more or risk liquidation.

If you have the necessary crypto assets and are comfortable with the risks, I recommend you proceed with an application to **Figure**.

I will now update the todo list to reflect that the analysis and recommendation are complete.
