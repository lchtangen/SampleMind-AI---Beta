# SampleMind AI Core

Welcome to the core repository for SampleMind AI, a revolutionary AI-powered music production platform based on neurologic physics and quantum-inspired audio processing.

## ðŸš€ Phase 1 (2025) Implementation

### Core Components

1. **Neurologic Audio Engine** - Bio-inspired audio processing based on neural oscillation patterns
2. **Quantum Superposition Sample Browser** - Advanced sample search and classification
3. **4D Audio Visualization** - Real-time WebGPU-powered audio visualization
4. **Adaptive Neural UI** - UI that adapts to audio content and user behavior

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/samplemind-core.git
   cd samplemind-core
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### Running Tests

To verify the installation and run the test suite:

```bash
python -m tests.test_neurologic_engine
```

This will:
1. Initialize the Neurologic Audio Engine
2. Process a test audio signal
3. Extract and visualize features
4. Test model persistence
